# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using the [typescript-eslint-stylelint-prettier-tailwindcss](https://github.com/rodrigolira/cra-template-typescript-eslint-stylelint-prettier-tailwindcss) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn lint-code`

Runs ESLint and output any style errors found in your code as per the rules defined in its [configuration](#eslint). By default, it will check any JavaScript or TypeScript file in your `src` folder.

### `yarn lint-code:fix`

Attempts to fix automatically any style errors detected in your code using [ESLint](#eslint) and [Prettier](#prettier). By default, it will check any JavaScript or TypeScript file in your `src` folder.

### `yarn lint-styles`

Runs Stylelint and output any style errors found in the `.css` files within your `src` folder.

Keep in mind that by default any other extensions (like `.scss` or `.less`) will not be checked by Stylelint. If you need that behavior you will need to change the configuration.

### `yarn lint-styles:fix`
